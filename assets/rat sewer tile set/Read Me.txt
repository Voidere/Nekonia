Congrats on your purchase of the "Vermin Sewer" Asset Pack.

This pack should contain:

1 - sample image
1 - rat idle stand
1 - rat run cycle (4 frames)
1 - complete tile set 
1 - pipe water animation (4 frames)
2 - water animations (10 frames each)
*the water animations are setup to animate at an offset to produce the most natural looking results. In actuality, there are only 10 original graphics.

We at MakBadGam would like to thank you personally and assure you that the funds gained from this purchase will help in the production of "BAD" games.
